# pythonScripts
This should be where I dump python scripts.
It's where I SHOULD have been dumping them all along, instead of making a new repo each time.
And eventually I'll move them all over because despite there being nearly two dozen, it won't take long.
In the meantime, this is where new python scripts will go.
